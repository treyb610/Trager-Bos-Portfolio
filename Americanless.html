  <p class="c6"><span class="c3 c11">American(less) Society</span></p>

  <p class="c6 c10"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Intro</span><span class="c1">:</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">The idea of American identity is complex and filled
  with turmoil. One can argue</span> <span class="c8">Identifying as "American" can
  involve speaking English, being born in the United States, embracing the culture, or
  simply participating in the capitalist market that fueled the country's economic
  success.</span> <span class="c1">In the novel</span> <span class="c5">The Reluctant
  Fundamentalist</span><span class="c1">, Mohsin Hamid does not view American identity as
  a distinct culture but as an absence of one. Hamid highlights that being American is
  not tethered to ethnicity or culture. Instead, it is about shedding one's previous
  identity to conform to the dominant empire.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Background Context</span><span class="c1">:</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5">The Reluctant Fundamentalist</span><span class=
  "c1">&nbsp;traces the journey of its protagonist, Changez, in a semi-bildungsroman
  style. A bildungsroman, defined in</span> <span class="c5">The Oxford Dictionary of
  Literary Terms</span><span class="c1">, is a novel "That follows the development of the
  hero or heroine from childhood or adolescence into adulthood, through a troubled quest
  for identity." (Baldick) While the novel does not directly delve into Changez's
  childhood, it initiates his story during his college years, follows him through his
  career, and ultimately explores his return to Pakistan, hence why one could consider
  Changez's story a semi-bildungsroman as it only traces a brief period of Changez's
  life. The story captures Changez's disconnection from his former self and his
  realization that he identifies more as Pakistani than American, embodying the quest for
  identity inherent in a bildungsroman.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Body</span><span class="c1">:</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Building on the theme of identity, the analysis
  delves into Changez's experience as he navigates the cultural landscape of New York
  City. Changez resided in New York City when hired by the firm Underwood Samson. Despite
  spending four years in New York, he retained aspects of his identity. The presence of
  Urdu-speaking taxi drivers and a Pak-Punjab Deli in his neighborhood allowed him to
  maintain connections to his past as he navigated life in a new country. Changez
  explicitly states, "I was, in four and a half years never an American; I was
  immediately a New Yorker" (Hamid 33). The passage illustrates that even in the United
  States, particularly New York City, Changez held onto some elements of his identity
  through language and cuisine that reminded him of home.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">However, there is a notable correlation between
  living in New York and being part of the American empire.</span> <span class=
  "c5">Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;discusses the
  connection between New York and the Empire, stating, "New York, the great commercial
  city of the USA, from its situation in the Empire State, the name given to New York
  State on account of its wealth and importance." Changez is in the heart of the American
  Empire, New York City. New York City is a significant economic and populous hub in the
  United States. New York is also a diverse city, as Changez can still maintain some of
  his identity through food and language. This dynamic showcases that America's identity
  is not solely defined by its culture but also by its role in production and influence.
  New York has many cultures but still maintains its role as an economic powerhouse for
  the U.S.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Moving beyond cultural identity, exploration of the
  economic dimensions of America's influence unfolds, as highlighted in Changez's
  journey.</span> <span class="c5">The Oxford Companion to International
  Relations</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;describes an empire as an "unbounded system of
  influence and rule" (Zielonka). Changez directly applies this term to the United States
  during his journey back from Chile, stating, "Finance was a primary form by which the
  American empire exercised its power" (Hamid 156). Changez's statement emphasizes the
  connection between America being an empire and its predominant tool for expanding
  influence, finance. Changez's claim contrasts with other empires that may rely on
  cultural influence or military force to spread their imperial reach.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Changez, a native of Pakistan, ventured to the United
  States for his education and later pursued a business career.</span> <span class=
  "c5">The Princeton Encyclopedia</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;defines this migration,
  often called brain drain, as "The emigration of skilled and professional workers (such
  as engineers, scientists, doctors, nurses, and university professors) from a country.
  These people emigrate legally, become residents or even citizens of a new country (the
  host or destination country), and stay there with no intention of returning to the
  source (sending) country" (Wong). The crucial aspect of this definition is that the
  brain drain victim does not return to the source/home but stays in the host country, in
  this case, the United States. Despite the prevalence of this system in many Western
  countries, Changez challenges the concept of brain drain. He reveals his reservations
  about this practice and, by the conclusion of the novel, decides to return to Pakistan
  permanently, divorcing himself from the pattern associated with brain drain.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Transitioning from the economic perspective,
  examining how the pursuit of wealth intertwines with the individual's sense of self
  comes into focus. The concept of brain drain hints at the idea that American identity
  is devoid of a distinct identity, emphasizing profit and labor. Instead of intending to
  return to their home country, the skilled laborer essentially adopts the host country
  as their new home. In</span> <span class="c5">The Reluctant
  Fundamentalist</span><span class="c1">, Changez reflects on this process, expressing,
  "Looking back now, I see the power of that system, pragmatic and effective, like so
  much else in America. We international students were sourced from around the globe,
  sifted not only by well-honed standardized tests but by painstakingly customized
  evaluations" (Hamid 4). The strict testing and selection process suggests how Changez
  perceives America as a system rather than a nation&mdash;a system lacking a specific
  identity, embodying an absence of identity.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Changez participates in America's economic pursuits,
  leaving his home country to pursue the wealth that America promises to individuals
  worldwide. In this perspective, America becomes more of a system than a defined entity,
  reinforcing that its identity lies in its economic mechanisms rather than cultural or
  national characteristics.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">The connection between the economy and American
  identity is further highlighted. In a scene where Changez discusses his time at
  Underwood Samson, a firm focused on evaluating overseas business, it illuminates
  American identity. Changez remarks, "At Underwood Samson, creativity was not excised -
  but it ceded its primacy to efficiency. Maximum return was the maxim to which we
  returned, time and time again" (Hamid 37). The Underwood Samson training underscores
  the link between the economy and American identity. Additionally, in Roberta's
  article</span> <span class="c5">(Mis)Reading in the Age of Terror: Promoting Racial
  Literacy through Counter-Colonial Narrative Resistance in the Post-9/11 Muslim
  Novel</span><span class="c1">, they point out that "Underwood Samson (which,
  abbreviated, has the same initials as the United States)." (Wolfson 242) The Underwood
  Samson abbreviation suggests that Underwood Samson serves as an allegory for the United
  States, implying that it is a system prioritizing maximum return and profit over
  creativity and individuality.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">In this allegory, Hamid suggests that Underwood
  Samson (representing the U.S.) is a system indifferent to creativity and individuality,
  focusing solely on maximizing returns. Changez's statement further reinforces this
  notion: "On that day I did not think of myself as a Pakistani, but as an Underwood
  Samson trainee" (Hamid 34). Changez's new "Underwood Samson trainee" identity
  highlights his act of shedding his past identity to conform to the values of Underwood
  Samson&mdash;a reflection of the broader idea that the U.S. is a system that molds
  individuals for economic efficiency.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Sandu's article</span> <span class="c5">New Cold War
  Nostalgia in Recent U.S. Cultural Productions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;further
  explores perceiving America as a system rather than a fixed cultural entity. The
  article explains how America's identity shifts based on its perceived threat,
  particularly in its historical relationship with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
  Sandu notes, "American identity still dependent on a real and imaginary relationship
  with its former enemies, unwilling at this point to fully renounce the Cold War binary
  dynamic." (</span><span class="c9">Sandu 628)</span> <span class="c1">&nbsp;The article
  suggests that America's identity is contingent on external factors, particularly its
  perceived threats, and it hesitates to let go of the Cold War mentality.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">In the context of</span> <span class="c5">New Cold
  War Nostalgia in Recent U.S. Cultural Productions</span><span class="c1">, this
  variable identity is portrayed in the media, emphasizing the dynamic relationship
  between America and the media. Moreover, it underscores that America's identity is
  flexible but adaptable, changing based on its interests, particularly in profits and
  defense. The media reflects this fluid identity as it adapts to portray
  whoever/whatever is perceived as America's current identity or threat.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">A scene from</span> <span class="c5">The Reluctant
  Fundamentalist</span><span class="c1">, where Changez observes his coworkers at
  Underwood Samson, underscores the link between media and America's capacity to reshape
  its perceived identity and culture. Despite their initial diversity in terms of gender
  and origin, Changez realizes that after training in a system focused on "maximum
  returns" (Hamid 37), they all become virtually indistinguishable. He notes, "I must be
  honest, it strikes me now - that shorn hair and dressed in battle fatigues, we would
  have been virtually indistinguishable" (Hamid 38). Changez's observation points out how
  Underwood Samson produces individuals devoid of distinct identities, akin to soldiers
  who become indistinguishable from one another.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Changez's coworker Wainwright notices Changez's
  realization and warns, "Beware of the dark side, young Skywalker" (Hamid 38), referring
  to Star Wars, a cultural giant in U.S. media. In this context, the "dark side" refers
  to surrendering one's identity, a concept that Changez is beginning to recognize. This
  interaction illustrates the interplay between culture and America, as highlighted by
  Hamid in the novel. The Star Wars reference further emphasizes the influence of media
  in shaping perceptions and warning against losing one's identity in the pursuit of
  conformity.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Examining the aftermath of societal changes, there is
  an exploration of how external threats contribute to the fluidity of America's
  identity. The transformation of American culture in response to perceived threats is
  vividly portrayed in the novel, particularly in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.
  Changez, being of Pakistani descent, becomes a victim of Islamophobia and persecution.
  Returning from Manila shortly after 9/11, he experiences a sense of detachment from
  America. He remarks, "When we arrived, I was separated from my team at immigration.
  They joined the queue for American citizens; I joined the one for foreigners" (Hamid
  75). This alienation becomes pivotal for Changez, prompting him to reevaluate his
  connection to American society.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Changez's rejection of American society became more
  pronounced during his time in New York after the attacks. He expresses, "Certainly, I
  wanted to believe; at least I wanted to not disbelieve with such intensity that I
  prevented myself as much as possible from making the obvious connection between the
  crumbling of the world around me and the impending destruction of my personal American
  dream" (Hamid 93). The dichotomy of Changez embracing his past while trying to
  integrate into a society that rejects him contributes to what he perceives as the world
  crumbling around him, ultimately shattering his American dream. The breaking of his
  reality highlights the profound impact of societal changes on an individual's sense of
  belonging and identity.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">Alghamdi delves into the division within Changez's
  psyche as a direct consequence of the American system in their article</span>
  <span class="c5">Shifting Positions: Identity and Alterity in the Reluctant
  Fundamentalist</span><span class="c1">. They suggest, "As a direct result, the reader
  is invited, at this stage of the monologue, to abandon any entrenched opinions
  regarding the morality (or lack thereof) of the American system" (Alghamdi 53). An
  interaction between Changez and a man named Juan-Bautista, a client of Changez during
  his time at Underwood Samson, exemplifies the concept of Changez working for a system
  that contradicts the values of his Pakistani identity. Juan-Bautista, a Chilean
  publisher, rejects Changez's assistance, viewing Underwood Samson as the opposite of
  culture. The firm's objective is to evaluate foreign media companies, potentially
  leading to their downfall and erasing a country's cultural output. Bautista,
  recognizing Changez's internal conflict since the events of 9/11, attempts to convey
  his perspective by introducing the concept of a Janissary.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">A janissary was a historical practice in the Ottoman
  Empire where Christian boys were captured and trained to fight for the Muslim Ottomans.
  Juan-Bautista highlighted this historical context to illustrate that Changez, a foreign
  individual residing in the United States and working for a firm deeply embedded in the
  American economic empire, mirrors the role of a janissary for the American empire. In
  this comparison, Changez finds himself torn between his foreign status and involvement
  in a system contributing to the potential danger his home country faces due to U.S.
  interference.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">The conversation with Juan-Bautista, likened by
  Changez to lifting a veil (Hamid 157), triggers a significant realization. Changez
  rejects his current self, resigns from his job, and returns to Pakistan, which he now
  sees as his true home. At this moment, Changez declares, "I resolved to look about me
  with an ex- janissary's gaze - with, that is to say, the analytical eyes of a product
  of Princeton and Underwood Samson" (Hamid 157). Changez's introspection reflects how
  education and work have stripped him of his identity, reducing him to viewing himself
  as a product rather than a person. Having experienced brain drain and worked in the
  finance sector, Changez seeks to disassociate from these aspects and promptly return
  home to Lahore.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Conclusion</span><span class="c1">:</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">The analysis concludes by examining how Changez's
  journey culminates in a decisive rejection of assimilation and a reclamation of his
  true identity. Changez's semi-bildungsroman, encompassing his college and career in
  finance, illuminates the empirical system projected by America to assert power and
  influence. Viewing himself as a product of these industries and perceiving his
  coworkers as interchangeable reflects a focus on wealth over individual identity.
  Experiencing the aftermath of the 9/11 disaster, Changez witnesses how swiftly the
  society he aspired to be a part of can turn against him. This fluidity in the American
  attitude also points to a lack of a fixed identity, a notion Changez hints at in
  conversations about the history of Pakistan. Changez emphasizes the importance of
  history in shaping identity, highlighting the contrast between Pakistan's ancient
  history and America's relatively brief one. The analogy of Changez being a janissary
  underscores the dichotomy of working for an empire that is hostile toward its agents.
  The title,</span> <span class="c5">The Reluctant Fundamentalist</span><span class=
  "c1">, aligns with</span> <span class="c5">The Encyclopedia of Social
  Problems</span><span class="c1">' definition of fundamentalism as the "Strict adherence
  and maintenance of traditional perspectives in reaction against secularism and
  modernism" (Okafor). In the novel's conclusion, Changez rejects the erasure of his
  identity and embraces his Pakistani heritage, an act of resistance against the American
  Empire's attempt to dehumanize and assimilate him into the financial superpower
  portrayed by the U.S.</span></p>
